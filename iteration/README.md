In Ruby, #each is an incredibly powerful tool that can be used to help solve many of the programming challenges you will come across.  The test files in the exercise folder will help you expand your knowledge of what #each can do and push you to think about the power of simple iteration.

The exercises can be completed in any order, but if you would like a suggestion, see below:
